                   autonomous agents, requiring those agents to reason about
                   their own beliefs, as well as those of other agents.
                   However, planning involving nested beliefs is known to be
                   computationally challenging. In this work, we address the
                   task of synthesizing plans that necessitate reasoning about
                   the beliefs of other agents. We plan from the perspective of
                   a single agent with the potential for goals and actions that
                   involve nested beliefs, non-homogeneous agents, co-present
                   observations, and the ability for one agent to reason as if
                   it were another. We formally characterize our notion of
                   planning with nested belief, and subsequently demonstrate
                   how to automatically convert such problems into problems
                   that appeal to classical planning technology for solving
                   efficiently. Our approach represents an important step
                   towards applying the well-established field of automated
                   planning to the challenging task of planning involving
                   nested beliefs of multiple agents.",

  title    = "Planning with Perspectives -- Decomposing Epistemic Planning
              using Functional {STRIPS}",
  author   = "Hu, Guang and Miller, Tim and Lipovetzky, Nir",
  abstract = "In this paper, we present a novel approach to epistemic planning
              called planning with perspectives (PWP) that is both more
              expressive and computationally more efficient than existing
              state-of-the-art epistemic planning tools. Epistemic planning ---
              planning with knowledge and belief --- is essential in many
              multi-agent and human-agent interaction domains. Most
              state-of-the-art epistemic planners solve epistemic planning
              problems by either compiling to propositional classical planning
              (for example, generating all possible knowledge atoms or
              compiling epistemic formulae to normal forms); or explicitly
              encoding Kripke-based semantics. However, these methods become
              computationally infeasible as problem sizes grow. In this paper,
              we decompose epistemic planning by delegating reasoning about
              epistemic formulae to an external solver. We do this by modelling
              the problem using Functional STRIPS, which is more expressive
              than standard STRIPS and supports the use of external, black-box
              functions within action models. Building on recent work that
              demonstrates the relationship between what an agent `sees' and
              what it knows, we define the perspective of each agent using an
              external function, and build a solver for epistemic logic around
              this. Modellers can customise the perspective function of agents,
              allowing new epistemic logics to be defined without changing the
              planner. We ran evaluations on well-known epistemic planning
              benchmarks to compare an existing state-of-the-art planner, and
              on new scenarios that demonstrate the expressiveness of the PWP
              approach. The results show that our PWP planner scales
              significantly better than the state-of-the-art planner that we
              compared against, and can express problems more succinctly.",

    abstract="Effective planning requires good modeling languages and good algorithms. The Strips language has shaped most of the work in planning since the early 70{\textasciiacutex}s due to its effective solution of the frame problem and its support for divide-and-conquer strategies. In recent years, however, planning strategies not based on divide-and-conquer and work on theories of actions suggest that alternative languages can make modeling and planning easier. With this goal in mind, we have developed Functional Strips, a language that adds first-class function symbols to Strips providing additional flexibility in the codification of planning problems. This extension is orthogonal and complementary to extensions accommodated in other languages such as conditional effects, quantification, negation, etc. Function symbols, unlike relational symbols, can be nested so objects need not be referred to by their explicit names and as a result more efficient encodings can be provided. For example, a problem like the 8-puzzle can be codified in terms of four actions with no arguments; Hanoi, can be codified with a number of ground actions independent of the number of disks; resources and constraints can be easily represented, etc.",

However, we can also speak of common convictions held by different people, and of one and the same conviction being shared by different people. But then we are actually talking about the proposition each of these persons believes to be the respective content of their convictions, not (only) the proposition of being convinced experienced by the persons concerned. In other words, what we are talking about is the proposition A which is believed to be true by both X and Y, and not the propositions that X believes A or that Y believes A, respectively (in symbols: B(X, A) and B(Y, A)). The same goes for common knowledge. All the fact that X and Y have certain common convictions and common knowledge means is that for certain propositions A it holds that A is the content of the (correct) convictions expressed by B(X, A) and B(Y, A).",
